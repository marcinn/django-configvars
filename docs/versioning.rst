Versioned Documentation
=======================

Publishing model
----------------

The project uses ``sphinx-multiversion`` on GitHub Pages.

Published versions:

* release docs from tags
* ``latest`` alias pointing to the newest published release

Release docs are immutable because they are generated from tags only.

URL layout
----------

Typical URLs:

* ``https://marcinn.github.io/django-configvars/latest/``
* ``https://marcinn.github.io/django-configvars/<tag>/``

Use ``/latest/`` as the stable documentation URL.
